LikelyTo is a game that interacts with the Facebook api to grab photos and names of the user's Facebook friends. The user is then presented with three Facebook friends per game session, and is asked to answer a randomly presented question about these three friends.  Game results are stored on the device and presented to the user in a collection view.   The user can also share the results related to a specific friend to Facebook.  This application uses the Facebook api, Core Data, the programmatic construction of views, table views and buttons, collection views, UIView animations and NSNotification Center.
